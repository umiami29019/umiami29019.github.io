        <p>After Franco's death in <time datetime="1975">1975</time>, Spain transitioned to democracy, experienced rapid economic modernization, 
            
            and joined the <abbr title="european union">EU</abbr> in 1986 leading to a thriving economy.</p>

        <p>After <time datetime="2008">2008</time> and the devestating effects of the 2008 financial crisis, 
            
            Spain has continued its strong <abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr> growth (above the EU average) and is now the 4th-largest economy in the euro-zone.

        <p> According to Euronews, one of the main reasons for Spain's high unemployment is tight labour market regulations. This has caused regular open-ended contracts and fixed-term temporary contracts among younger, less skilled workers especialy within the tourism, contruction, and hospitality sectors.
