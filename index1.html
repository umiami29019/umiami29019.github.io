                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm born and raised in Queens, New York, and love New York City like nowhere else. 
                    I want to go back home after I graduate. I attended Stuyvesant High School and am 
                    now a senior at the University of Miami. At UM, I study Business Technology and Finance, 
                    giving me a tech, finance, and investment-oriented background because I love learning about 
                    innovation and making money. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some nicknames people call me are Bwong or Bluke.

                <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    My professional goal is to be an Investment / Research Analyst for an Investment Fund.
                    I want to analyze investment opportunities that may be underappreciated, keep up-to-date and 
                    predict market trends, and research new technologies. I aim to be part of the decision-making 
                    process and contribute to a firm's performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ideally, I would love to work in the crypto industry. It is early-staged, fast-paced, and 
                    constantly evolving. I love the community and learning about the innovative technologies 
                    that are always on the horizon. That said, I'm open to working in the traditional finance 
                    and banking industry, but crypto is where my passion truly lies.
