                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Bryan and I'm born and raised in Queens, New York. I love New York City like nowhere else and want to live here after I graduate  college. I attended a specialized high school called Stuyvesant and now I am a current senior at the University of Miami. At UM, I am studying Business Technology and Finance because of my interest in technology, innovation, and investments. I bring a strong background in business, finance, technology, crypto, and investments and am always looking forward to contribute my insights!
                </p>
                <p>
                    On occasions, people may call me BWong or BLuke as my nickname.

                <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    My professional goal is to be an Investment / Research Analyst for a large institution.
                    I enjoy analyzing investment opportunities to generate alpha, keeping up-to-date with 
                    relevant market trends, and researching new technologies and ideas. I love being a part of the decision-making 
                    process and contributing to a firm's success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ideally, I would love to work in the crypto industry. It is early-staged, fast-paced, and 
                    constantly evolving. I love the community  here, learning about the innovative technologies 
                    that are always on the horizonn, and I think there is a lot of investment and career growth potential.
                     That said, I am also open to working in the traditional finance and the banking industry, it's also important to establish fundamental skills in an established industry.
