                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Bryan,  I'm 21 years old, and I'm born and raised in Queens, New York. For high school, I attended Stuyvesant and now I am a current senior at the University of Miami. At UM, I am studying Business Technology and Finance because of my interest in technology, innovation, and investments. I bring a strong background in business, finance, technology, crypto, and investments and I am always looking forward to contribute my insights!  I love New York City like nowhere else and want to live here after I graduate college.

                <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    My professional goal is to be an Investment / Research Analyst for a large institution.
                    I enjoy analyzing investment opportunities to generate alpha, keeping up-to-date with 
                    market trends, and researching new technologies and ideas. I love being a part of executive decision-making processes and contributing to a firm's success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ideally, I would love to work in the crypto industry. It is early-staged, fast-paced, and constantly evolving. I've been involved for the past 3 years - and I love the community here, learning about the innovative technologies, and I think there is a lot of investment and career growth potential. That said, I am also open to working in the traditional finance and the banking industry, it's also important to establish fundamental skills in an established industry.
                </p>
