            <h2>Macro Economic Take</h2>
            <p> I am quite bullish on the current macro environment today. With a potential rate cut by mid Decemeber, an increasing global liquidity (M2 money supply), resilent consumer spending, the 10Y treasury rate decreasing and is now under 4.2%, and inflation remain relatively static at a annual rate of 2.6% - I believe the market, especially for risk-on assets, will continue to trend higher until Q2 - Q3 2025. I do believe there is a 20% chance of a recession by end of next year.</p>

            <h2>My Personal Investing Experience</h2>
            <p> My welcome to the market moment was when I didn't know anything about trading stock options and lost $3K my freshman year. Since then I've continued to learn and improve my knowledge in the markets and in continued to invest in my personal portfolio - I've since grown my Roth IRA account by 300%, am up 50% in my crypto portfolio, and have a much more comprehensive view on the macro conditions for financial markets today. I've also joined many finance and investment clubs at the University of Miami including SMIF, the school's $2M endowment fund, and the Canes Finance Association. </p>

            <p> I've also managed to intern at various buy side digital asset investment firms including Meta4 Capital (NFT Investment and Lending Fund), WWVentures (Web3 Venture Fund), and Arca (Digital Asset Hedge Fund). My roles were primarily as investment and research analyst interns, and I've continued to grow as an analyst in the crypto industry.</p>
