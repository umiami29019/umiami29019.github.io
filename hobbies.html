                <h2>Working Out</h2>
                <p> I enjoy going to the gym regularly. It's a great way for me to stay fit, relieve stress, and challenge myself to improve my strength and endurance. I focus on weightlifting and I am trying to maintain a weight goal of 160 lbs (right now I am at 155lbs).</p>

                <h2>Playing Basketball</h2>
                <p> Basketball has always been one of my favorite sports. My favorite teams are the New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers, and my GOAT is Lebron James. I also enjoy playing pick up basketball and love the teamwork, competition, and strategy involved.</p>

            <!-- Reading -->
            <section id="reading">
                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p> Reading is one of my favorite ways to relax and expand my knowledge. I primarily enjoy reading about books in the investing, trading, and finance space. I've recently been reading Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas, which has reshaped how I approach risk and my investing mentality. Byeond finance, I sometimes explore pscyhology and self-improvement books, as they provide valuable insights into human behavior and how I can grow from these insights.</p>

            <!-- Listening to Music -->
            <section id="music">
                <h2>Listening to Music</h2>
                <p> Music is a huge part of my life. I listen to a wide variety of genres, but my top three are EDM, Pop, and Rap. I listen to these songs during walks or at the gym which help keep me motivated and focused or at home when I need to relax. </p>
